         <h2>Atlanta, GA </h2>
         <p>Having grown up in the South, it was normal for me to go to Altanta for our family summer trip. It was a week
            long event and during that time we would stay at a hotel in Atlanta and drive about 15 mins to the Six Flags over Georgia
            amusement park. My parents would get season passes every year so we always knew that we was going to our favorite summertime places as kids. My siblings and I
            couldn't wait for the end of school to come, because we knew it was Summer Vacation 1time. It was the absolute best!

         <h2>Marietta, GA</h2>
         <p>Marietta, GA is where the waterpark called White Water is located which is about 30 minutes from Atlanta, GA, 
            and White Water which is the waterpark that isn't that far away from Six Flags over Georgia was anothe places 
            that we spend a great deal of time at during our trip to Georgia. We would spend three days at the waterpark 
            while we were there and we loved every minute of it. My parents also I think enjoyed just seeing how happy we 
            were. When weren't at either park. We would simply spend time walking around Downtown Atlanta shopping for souvenirs of our trip. Those were the good ole days.
