            <h2>Atlanta, GA </h2>
            <div>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Having grown up in the South, it was normal for me to go to Altanta for our family summer trip. It was a
               week long event and during that time we would stay at a hotel in Atlanta and drive about 15 mins to the
               Six
               Flags over Georgia amusement park. My parents would get season passes every year so we always knew that
               we was
               going to our favorite summertime places as kids. My siblings and I
               couldn't wait for the end of school to come, because we knew it was Summer Vacation time. We just loved
               riding on all the really big roller coaster rides.
               My sister is really the adventuous one. I rode my fair share, but yet just sitting here now thinking back
               is bringing a smile
               to my face. It was the absolute best!

            <h2>Marietta, GA</h2>
            <div>
            <p>Marietta, GA is where the waterpark called White Water is located which is about 30 minutes from Atlanta,
               GA,
               and White Water which is the waterpark that isn't that far away from Six Flags over Georgia was another
               places
               that we spend a great deal of time at during our trip to Georgia. We would spend three days at the
               waterpark
               while we were there and we loved every minute of it. There are so many different types of water slides
               here that we
               enjoyed riding on all day long. The really tall slides scared me. I tend to stick to the slides that were
               in the
               middle not too tall or too small. My brother loved the tall water slides. He's a great swimmer though so
               not sure if
               that had anything to do with it but... My parents also I think enjoyed just seeing how happy we were.
               When weren't at
               either park. We would simply spend time walking around Downtown Atlanta shopping for souvenirs of our
               trip.
               Those were the good ole days.

            <h2>El Paso, TX</h2>
         <div>
            <p>El Paso, TX is a beautiful city. I really enjoyed feeling like I was in a tropical location because the
               tree looked
               different the regular trees that I was use to seeing. And the fact that I could wear shorts and a t-shirt
               in the middle
               of winter was also super awesome...lol. It gets very very hot there in the summertime, which was kind of
               a Catch 22.
               During the time that I spent there in the summer we only went out at night. The day time hours were used
               for sleeping...lol.
               As it was to hot for anything else really.We would wait until the sun went down and BBQ and listen to
               music and have the best
               time. But, overall a beautiful city that I would gladly migrate to in the winter.

            <h2>Ciudad Juarez, MX</h2>
         <div>
            <p>When I was in El Paso we took a quick trip over the bridge and entered into Mexico into a city called
               Ciudad
               (which means city or town in Spanish) Juarez. They have a lot of different kinds of street markets
               whereyou can
               buy anything from flowers, food, musical instruments and more. It was great to be able to experience the rich
               culture there
               hearing all the beautiful tejano music being palyed in the shops andd even the mariachi bands playing on
               the
               sidewalks throughout the city as well. I loved how colorful it was there. I jsut made me smile so much I
               love color
               and beatiful things and I got both. Crossing the border was a little scary, but all and all I liked my
               visit here.

                  <h2>Anthony, TX</h2>
               <div>
                  <p>Shortly before ending my stay in the beautiful Southwest region of our country. 
                     I had the opportunity to visit Anthony, TX which isn't to far from Anthony, NM. 
                     But there's a waterpark here called Wet 'N Wild. They have some awesome water rides and slides here. 
                     If you can't tell by now yes I have a thing for the water and water parks are one of favorite places to visit in the summer time. 
                     A group of friends and I made our way to the lovely park and spent the day riding the too many to count rides and tailgated in the parking lot. 
                     Yea we really did. And would go back in after we ate and our food had digested and rode some more. 
                     The sounds of all the people laughing and cheering and even screaming... there were screams lol. Was just so invorigorating. 
                     I loved been amongst all the people on the extremely hot summer day enjoying the water and the overall atmosphere. 
                     I can remember one of my friends wanting the rie the tallest ride in there called the Amazon. 
                     They stood in long for over an hour just to ride it. They said it was the best. If you wondering if I rode it the answer is "No".

                  <h2>Greenwich, CT</h2>
               <div>
                  <p>My visit to Greenwich, CT is so memorable to me because of the easy lifestyle that it conveyed to me. 
                     I saw people just leisurely strolling down the street seemingly in no hurry at all. 
                     With the hustle and bustle of many other cities where you see people just rushing around. 
                     That was the contrast that really stood out to me. 
                     I like all the little quaint storefronts that lines many of the streets there. 
                     Watching the people windowshopping and browsing there the various types of stores. 
                     It reminded me to slow down and to be more present and in the moment. 
                     It also seemed so family-friendly and cozy. 
                     I feel like if I could live anywhere else, I'd live to live here.

                  <h2>Gatlinburg, TN</h2>
               <div>
                  <p>During my time in Gatlinburg, TN, I visited several places. The one that stood out the most to me on the 
                     trip was the Ripley's Believe it or Not Aquarium. Not only was ther fish and sharks and all stuff oceanic. They had different little platy areas set up for you to explore like holding, 
                     touching, rubbing different animals. But the ultimate highlight of this trip was by far the tunnel. 
                     In the aquarium where the sharks and sting rays are literally swimming over your head. 
                     Honestly it took a lot of coaxing for me to go through it. But i did and it was astonding to say the least.
